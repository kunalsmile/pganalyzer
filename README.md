# pgAnalyzer
The intent of building is project was to have an UI tool to display the mapping between tables and indexes in postgres.
This also shows the table size and index size for a given database.
This also shows the number of scans happened for a given index.
The UI is designed with all the filters and makes it user friendly rather than going to DB and executing commands to capture the required data.

## Getting Started
To get started you can download the repo. After downloading the repo you should see two directories under the root directory named client and server.
You need to open the CLI of your own choice and navigate to each directory and execute npm install. This will make sure to download all the dependencies.


### Prerequisites
You should have latest node installed on your system.
